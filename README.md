# Meals & Recipes using React

A simple recipe app that pulls from a local json file containing all recipe data and then converted into a javascript object.

The data is all mapped to list items and the data is sorted by tabs. Tapping on a list item will display a fullscreen modal with the recipe data pulled from the json.

Deployed using vercel here:
